##GPS 1.1 - Version Control and Git - Reflection

###What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

The thing that confused me most was understanding what the "right" workflow is for branching modifying, and then merging. I know that we were tought to create a repo in git, pull down that repo using clone, branch off, modify, push back to github, pull, and merge.  My teammate, having had some experience with version control wanted to merge the branch locally to master before pushing up to github. At first, it was hard for me to explain why one wouldn't want to do this.

###What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

I realized after thinking this through that one wouldn't want to perform a local merge because then others collaborating on the project wouldnt be able to see the feature branch and discuss the change before allowing the push to the master.

###What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

We asked our guide what their opinion of using "pull" as opposed to "fetch and merge" was.  We also talked about case sensitivty with login names for github when making changes through terminal to a remote repository. My pair and I spent a decent bit of time discussing/researching how to use .md styles. It was kind of funny because we were both delerious and couldn't at first figure out why the Block Code wasn't working. After using a concerted effort, we realized we were using apostrophes instead of backticks.

###What still confuses you about git?

It sounds like a cheap answer, but most of confused me about GIT is that which I do not know. I feel very comfortable with the current workflow. Since I don't want to leave that as my only answer, the other thing that confuses me would be how to work on remote repository that is **NOT** in GitHub, such as remote server set up.

###How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I have to say that my first experience was really exhilarting and fun. I was definitely nervous at first, but after we both became delerious from working together for so long, we became very comfortable working with one another. I think we both learned a lot together and we both solified our knowledge by working as a team.
