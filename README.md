##Also discuss how git tracks changes, different stages, and the process

Git is able to track changes by working with files in a specified directory, called a repository.

For this challenge, we created our repository on github first, and we used the git clone to pull the repository down locally to our machine.

In the repository, we needed to create a file first before staging it. For this challenge, we added a file first using the "touch" command. Then we staged it by using git add.

After checking it via git status, we knew it was ready to commit using git commit -m "message".

Finally, we were able to push it back to our github master using "git push origin master".

At this point, once the changes are pushed back to the master, my collaborator, Frankie, was able to clone the repository.
